# GRIME: Graphical Image Manipulation and Enhancement

> **ðŸ“Œ Code available upon request.**

GRIME is a Java-based image processing application that provides both **graphical** and **command-line** interfaces for performing advanced image manipulation. It was developed as part of the **Programming Design Paradigm (PDP)** course in the Masterâ€™s in Computer Science program.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

GRIME offers a wide range of image enhancement and manipulation capabilities through a dual-interface system:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Java Swing
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for batch processing and scripting

Users can load images in formats such as PNG, JPG, etc., apply a series of transformations, preview the results, and save the final image. Whether you're a developer automating image workflows or an end-user looking to enhance photos, GRIME provides a flexible and modular toolset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Demonstrate **clean software design** using **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
- Provide both GUI and CLI usage options
- Support a wide range of **image operations**
- Allow **custom scripting** for complex workflows (CLI mode)
- Focus on **modularity**, **extensibility**, and **testability**

## ðŸ§± Architecture

### MVC Breakdown:

- **Model**: Handles the image data and processing logic.
- **View**: Displays the interfaceâ€”either via GUI components or CLI output.
- **Controller**: Bridges user actions with model operations.

### Packages:
